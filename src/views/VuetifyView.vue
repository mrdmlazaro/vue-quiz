        <p> Vuetify is a full-featured UI framework built on Vue.js. The project's goal is to give developers the tools
            they need to create rich and engaging user experiences. Unlike other frameworks, Vuetify is built from the
            ground up to be simple to learn and rewarding to master, with hundreds of carefully crafted Material Design
            components.
            <br><br>
            Vuetify designs for mobile first, which means your application will work right away on any deviceâ€”phone,
            tablet, or desktop computer.
            <br><br>
            Since its initial release in 2014, Vue.js has grown to be one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks in
            the world. One of the reasons for this popularity is the wide use of components which enable developers to
            create concise modules to be used and re-used throughout their application. UI Libraries are collections of
            these modules that implement a specific style guideline and provide the necessary tools to build expansive
            web applications.
